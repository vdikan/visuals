* Visuals

A collection of utiity packages for visual stuff, written in Lisp.

As it seems, nothing beats in-browser Js systems for plotting and drawing.

Inspirations:

 * [[https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/][Vega-Lite]] plotting grammar system:
   nice looks, and it is easy to setup [[https://bl.ocks.org/domoritz/8e1e4da185e1a32c7e54934732a8d3d5][with data coming from WebSockets]].
   (I actually found out about Vega when ran into [[https://github.com/kilimanjaro/plotsdam][Plotsdam]], a thin wrapper over it)
 * [[https://github.com/byulparan/websocket-demo][This demo]] of injecting REPL from CL+Parenscript to Js console,
   itself as well as its aim to create interactive WebGL scene.

** Usage

See ~.lisp~ sources in ~/examples~

** TODOs

 * understand routing of ~Clack~ apps
 * ~ws-repl~ improvements: command IDs, error-handlings
